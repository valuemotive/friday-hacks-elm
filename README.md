## Running Elm apps

In order to build/run these examples you need to have the Elm platform and `create-elm-app` installed.

Easiest way to get both is to use NPM:

`npm install -g elm create-elm-app`

You might be able to find the Elm platform in your OS package manager registry, like in Homebrew (`brew install elm`).

The Elm community has adopted a pseudo-official formatter, `elm-format`. It's supported by most editor plugins. Get it via:

`npm install -g elm-format`

The [VS Code extension](https://github.com/elm-tooling/vscode-elm) is great. It can format and check your code, and autocomplete your code.

## Examples

### A Simple Counter

Subfolder `counter-simple`

A pure Elm app, and therefore can be built via `elm make src/Main.elm`, or you can use `elm reactor` (recommended) to run it locally and built on demand.

### Http-based Counter

Subfolder `counter-http`

A pure Elm app too, see instructions for `counter-simple`.

Uses [counter-as-a-service](https://github.com/klemola/counter-as-a-service) as the backend. Deployed to [Heroku as `caas-demo`](https://caas-demo.herokuapp.com/).

### JavaScript Interop

Subfolder `js-interop`

Project generated by `create-elm-app`. `elm reactor` doesn't support JavaScript interop, so you'll need to use the `elm-app start` command to see the project in action.
